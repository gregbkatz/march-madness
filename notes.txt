Things to check or change
 * Hardcode first round playin winners in forecast.py
 * Check region ordering in sort_first_games() forecast.py
 * Check region ordering in yahoo_sort_teams() in picks.py
 * Hardcode group_id in run_yahoo_parsing in yahoo_parsing.py
 * Hardcode scoring in score_brackets in compete.py
 * Add to synonyms.py as necessary to match up between yahoo team names and 538 forecast team names. 
 * Make a "50/50" forecast by changing the rating column to all 1 in 538 forecast csv


What to run
 * Run search_picks.py to make picks
 * Run compete.py to score a specific truth scenario file
 * Run scenarios.py to run a batch of scenarios


ToDo
 * When creating scenario.truth files give them more unique names so the brackets are regenerated rather than loading from cache
 * Something is funky with output of scenarios.py
 * Keep cleaning up scenarios.py
 * Make plots of history in scenarios
 * More data mining for getting scenarios without running specific truth files
 * Visualization of picks and scenarios
 * Ultimate goal: gui for outcomes with turning on/off truth scenarios like 538
 * Convert ids to bracket? 
 * Switch to just using probabiltiies instad of monte carlo
